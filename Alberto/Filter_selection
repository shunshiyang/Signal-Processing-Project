1. Butterworth 4th Order
Advantages:

Maximally flat passband (no ripple)

Smooth phase response

Simple implementation

Numerically stable

Disadvantages:

Gradual roll-off (≈40dB attenuation at 0-5Hz)

Requires higher order for sharp transitions

2. Butterworth 8th Order
Advantages:

≈80dB attenuation at 0-5Hz

Still maintains no passband ripple

Better stopband rejection than 4th order

Disadvantages:

Increased phase distortion

Slightly higher computational cost

Potential stability issues in fixed-point implementations

3. Chebyshev Type I 6th Order (0.1dB ripple)
Advantages:

≈100dB attenuation at 0-5Hz

Sharper transition than Butterworth

Lower order needed for similar attenuation

Disadvantages:

0.1dB passband ripple

Non-linear phase response

More sensitive to coefficient quantization

4. Elliptic 4th Order (0.1dB ripple, 60dB attenuation)
Advantages:

≈120dB attenuation at 0-5Hz

Sharpest transition of all

Lowest order needed

Disadvantages:

Ripple in both passband and stopband

Worst phase linearity

Complex design

5. Cascade: 6th Order Highpass (5Hz) + 6th Order Lowpass (24.9Hz)
Advantages:

≈120dB attenuation at 0-5Hz

No passband ripple

Independent control of cutoffs

Better phase response than elliptic/Chebyshev

Disadvantages:

Requires two filtering operations

Slightly higher latency

More parameters to tune
